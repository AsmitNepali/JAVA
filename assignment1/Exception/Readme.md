# User-defined Custom Exception in Java

Java provides us facility to create our own exceptions which are basically derived classes of `Exception`. For example MyException in below code extends the Exception class
We pass the string to the constructor of the super class- Exception which is obtained using “getMessage()” function on the object created.

## Syntax:

	class custom_expetion_name Extends Exception
	{
		// Statement
	}
