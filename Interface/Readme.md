# Default method in interface

Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The implementation of these methods has to be provided in a separate class. So, if a new method is to be added in an interface, then its implementation code has to be provided in the class implementing the same interface. To overcome this issue, Java 8 has introduced the concept of default methods which allow the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes that implement the interface.
