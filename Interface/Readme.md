# Default method in interface

Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The implementation of these methods has to be provided in a separate class. So, if a new method is to be added in an interface, then its implementation code has to be provided in the class implementing the same interface. To overcome this issue, Java 8 has introduced the concept of default methods which allow the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes that implement the interface.

**Default methods** enable you to add new functionality to existing interfaces and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces. In particular, **default methods** enable you to add **methods** that accept lambda expressions as parameters to existing interfaces.

`default` **keyword** is used for define default method.

## Syntax:
	
	default method_name()
	{
		// Statement 
	}
